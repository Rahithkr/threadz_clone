                <li>Threads is a new app, built by the Instagram team, for sharing text <br>updates and joining public conversations.</li><br>
                <li>You log in using your Instagram account and posts can be up to 500<br> characters long and include links, photos, and videos up to 5 minutes in<br> length.</li><br>
                <li>We’re working on Threads soon being compatible with the open,<br> interoperable social networks that we believe can shape the future of<br> the internet</li><br>
            </ul>
            <h3>Mark Zuckerberg just announced the initial version of Threads, an app built<br> by the Instagram team for sharing with text. Whether you’re a creator or a <br>casual poster, Threads offers a new, separate space for real-time updates<br> and public conversations. We are working toward making Threads<br> compatible with the open, interoperable social networks that we believe can <br>shape the future of the internet.<br>

                Instagram is where billions of people around the world connect over photos<br> and videos. Our vision with Threads is to take what Instagram does best and <br>expand that to text, creating a positive and creative space to express your<br> ideas. Just like on Instagram, with Threads you can follow and connect with <br>friends and creators who share your interests – including the people you<br> follow on Instagram and beyond. And you can use our existing suite of safety<br> and user controls.</h3><br>

                <h1>Join the Conversation from Instagram</h1>
                <h3>It’s easy to get started with Threads: simply use your<br> Instagram account to log in. Your Instagram username and verification will carry over,<br> with the option to customize your profile specifically for Threads.</h3><br>
                <img src="third.webp">
                <br>
                <h3>Everyone who is under 16 (or under 18 in certain countries) will<br> be defaulted into a private profile when they join Threads.<br> You can choose to follow the same accounts you do on Instagram, and<br> find more people who care about the same things you do.<br> The core accessibility features available on Instagram today, such as <br>screen reader support and AI-generated image descriptions, are <br>also enabled on Threads.</h3><br>
                <img src="fourth.webp">
                <h3>Your feed on Threads includes threads posted by people you <br>follow, and recommended content from new creators you haven’t <br>discovered yet. Posts can be up to 500 characters long and<br> include links, photos, and videos up to 5 minutes in length. You<br> can easily share a Threads post to your Instagram story, or<br> share your post as a link on any other platform you choose.<br></h3>

                <h1>Tune Out the Noise</h1><br>
                <h3>We built Threads with tools to enable positive, productive<br> conversations. You can control who can mention you or reply to <br>you within Threads. Like on Instagram, you can add hidden words <br>to filter out replies to your threads that contain specific words.<br> You can unfollow, block, restrict or report a profile on Threads by<br> tapping the three-dot menu, and any accounts you’ve blocked on <br>Instagram will automatically be blocked on Threads.<br></h3><br>
                <h3>As with all our products, we’re taking safety seriously, and we’ll<br> enforce Instagram’s Community Guidelines on content and <br>interactions in the app. Since 2016 we’ve invested more than $16<br> billion in building up the teams and technologies needed to<br> protect our users, and we remain focused on advancing our <br>industry-leading integrity efforts and investments to protect our <br>community.</h3><br>

                <h1>Compatible with Interoperable Networks</h1>
                <h3>Soon, we are planning to make Threads compatible with<br> ActivityPub, the open social networking protocol established by <br>the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the body responsible for <br>the open standards that power the modern web. This would make <br>Threads interoperable with other apps that also support the <br>ActivityPub protocol, such as Mastodon and WordPress – <br>allowing new types of connections that are simply not possible on<br> most social apps today. Other platforms including Tumblr have <br>shared plans to support the ActivityPub protocol in the future.<br></h3>
                <img src="seventh.webp">
                <br>
                <h3>We’re committed to giving you more control over your audience <br>on Threads – our plan is to work with ActivityPub to provide you <br>the option to stop using Threads and transfer your content to<br> another service. Our vision is that people using compatible apps <br>will be able to follow and interact with people on Threads without <br>having a Threads account, and vice versa, ushering in a new era <br>of diverse and interconnected networks. If you have a public<br> profile on Threads, this means your posts would be accessible <br>from other apps, allowing you to reach new people with no added<br> effort. If you have a private profile, you’d be able to approve <br>users on Threads who want to follow you and interact with your<br> content, similar to your experience on Instagram.<br></h3><br>

                <h3>The benefits of open social networking protocols go well beyond<br> the ways people can follow each other. Developers can build new <br>types of features and user experiences that can easily plug into<br> other open social networks, accelerating the pace of innovation<br> and experimentation. Each compatible app can set its own<br> community standards and content moderation policies, meaning <br>people have the freedom to choose spaces that align with their <br>values. We believe this decentralized approach, similar to the<br> protocols governing email and the web itself, will play an<br> important role in the future of online platforms.<br></h3><br>
                <h3>Threads is Meta’s first app envisioned to be compatible with an<br> open social networking protocol – we hope that by joining this<br> fast-growing ecosystem of interoperable services, Threads will <br>help people find their community, no matter what app they use.<br></h3>

                <h1>What’s Next</h1>
                <h3>We’re rolling out Threads today in more than 100 countries for<br> iOS and Android, and people in those countries can download the<br> app from the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.<br></h3><br>
                <h3>In addition to working toward making Threads compatible with <br>the ActivityPub protocol, soon we’ll be adding a number of new<br> features to help you continue to discover threads and creators<br> you’re interested in, including improved recommendations in feed <br>and a more robust search function that makes it easier to follow <br>topics and trends in real time.<br></h3><br>
                <h3>We’re excited to hear your feedback as we work to build new <br>features and introduce fun new ways to connect on the app.<br></h3>
